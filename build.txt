BUILD
-----

Configurations "Debug-U6" and "Release-U6" are for Umbraco v6.
  Both define compile constant UMBRACO_6
  Which is used in Zbu.Yol.Security

Umbraco dependencies
  The following libs must be in lib/umbraco:
    businesslogic.dll
	cms.dll
	interfaces.dll
	log4net.dll
	Umbraco.Core.dll
	umbraco.dll

  In order to build for v6 the same libs must be in lib/umbraco-v6
  These are conditional references in csproj files

Package (NuGet) is created for "Release" build only, in the build directory.
